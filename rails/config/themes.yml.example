# Mastodon Themes Configuration
# Location: config/themes.yml
#
# Note: Matrix theme doesn't need to be registered here!
# It works via body class toggle (theme-matrix), not as a separate theme file.
# This is intentional - it allows runtime switching via Ctrl+Shift+M

default: styles/application.scss
contrast: styles/contrast.scss
mastodon-light: styles/mastodon-light.scss

# Optional: If you want Matrix as a selectable theme in user preferences:
# matrix: styles/MATRIX_matrix.scss
